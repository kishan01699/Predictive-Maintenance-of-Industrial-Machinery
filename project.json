This project will involve analyzing sensor data from machinery\nto identify patterns that precede a failure. The goal is to create a classification model that\ncan predict the type of failure (e.g., tool wear, heat dissipation, power failure) based on\nreal-time operational data. This will enable proactive maintenance, reducing downtime\nand operational costs.","public":false,"storage":{"type":"bmcos_object_storage","guid":"aa46a4de-0f93-4143-8a3b-afa99d3e9e4f"},"scope":{"bss_account_id":"2836e3f715e04e07a96875d46c492245","enforce_members":true},"settings":{"access_restrictions":{"data":false,"reporting":{"authorized":false}},"audit_events":{"enabled":false}},"type":"cpd","creator":"kishan.kj.1699@gmail.com","creator_iam_id":"IBMid-6910010L52","members":[{"id":"IBMid-6910010L52","state":"ACTIVE","type":"user","user_name":"kishan.kj.1699@gmail.com","role":"admin"}],"catalog":{"public":false,"guid":"30cca96d-4a82-4feb-929d-b9ee524dd418"}},"required_services":[],"is_encrypted":false,"deployment_source":"cloud","version":"1.2.0.cloud"}
